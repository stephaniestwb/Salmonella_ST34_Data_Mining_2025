# Project: Population genomics project for *Salmonella* Monophasic ST34.

### Objectives
* To identify and rank the most discriminative genomic features (AMR genes, shell genes, and plasmid genes) associated with different sources or epidemiological clusters of Salmonella ST34 using Random Forest classification.
* To evaluate the distribution patterns and clustering of shell genes across isolates to uncover potential hidden population structures within epidemiological clusters.
* To assess the predictive value of top-ranked genes through proportion-based confusion matrix analysis, identifying features with the highest discriminatory power across different training/test splits.

## How to Read
This repository is divided by sets, each corresponding to a specific scenario proposed in the paper. 
Each folder contains 7 Jupyter Notebooks (one for each figure and one with the full code) and one folder containing all the files used by the codes (these files can also be found here for [set 1](https://figshare.com/s/ee922a1d35c031908978), [set 2](https://figshare.com/s/208104531264a3db6366) and [set 3](https://figshare.com/s/91557c6cf134885d08ff)).
